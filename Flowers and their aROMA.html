<h1>The Ten Most Fragrant Flowers for a Blissfully Scented Garden</h1>
<ol>
<p><li><i>Sweet Alyssum</p></li></i>
<p>Pollinators will come from miles around to treat themselves to the nectar of this delicate annual. The tiny blooms produce a strong, sweet scent that is one-of-a-kind. Plant sweet alyssum in containers, hanging baskets, or window boxes. Its small root system adapts well to rock gardens, and it performs as a durable, flowering ground cover. Select a home for your alyssum that provides full to partial sunlight.</p>
<p><li><i>The Colorful Scented Primrose – Primula</p></li></i>
    The Primrose opens wide in spring;
    Her scent is sweet and good:
    It smells of every happy thing
    In sunny lane and wood.</p>
    <p><li><i>The Gentle Citrusy Mock Orange</p></li></i>

        … And the scent of mock orange
        drifts through the window.
        How can I rest?
        How can I be content
        when there is still
        that odor in the world?</p>
        <p><li><i>The Creamy Clove-Like Viburnum</p></li></i>
            “A garden without a viburnum is akin to life without music and art.”</li></p>
            <p><li><i>The Warm Sugary Honeysuckle</p></li></i>
                “They lay on their heathery beds and listened to all the sounds of the night. …They smelt the drifting scent of honeysuckle, and the delicious smell of wild thyme crushed under their bodies. A reed-warbler sang a beautiful little song in the reeds below, and then another answered.”</p>
                <p><li><i>The Sweet Pure Lily of the Valley</p></li></i>
                    Where scattered wild the Lily of the Vale
                    Its balmy essence breathes.</p>
                    <p><li><i>The Exotic and Elegant Freesia</p></li></i>
                        “Reverence and joy brought delicate peace, which surrounded her like the perfume of the flowers themselves. The happiness of that afternoon was already fixed in her mind, and always would the scent of freesia recall it to her mental sight …”</p>
                        <p><li><i>The Velvety And Alluring Gardenia</p></li></i>
                            “Like a fist if a fist could sing,” wrote poet Cornelius Eady about the white gardenias famously worn by the legendary jazz singer Billie Holiday.</p>
                            <p><li><i>Paperwhite – Narcissus Papyraceus</p></li></i>
                            Upon entering my grandmother’s enormous front hall at Christmastime, I would shut my eyes and breathe deeply. Like a pine forest in the summer rain, the house was redolent with deeply spicy, green balsam, but it was softened with the fresh sweetness of paperwhites, like a gentle welcoming smile.</p>
                            <p><li><i>Last but not least as a <i>BONUS</i>: THE ROSE</p></li></i>
                            As Alice Morse Earle wrote, “The fragrance of the sweetest rose is beyond any other flower scent, it is irresistible, enthralling; you cannot leave it. I have never doubted the rose has some compelling quality not shared by other flowers. I do not know whether it comes from some inherent witchery of the plant, but it certainly exists.”

No list of fragrant flowers is complete without the rose. “Loveliness extreme,” the rose is classic, iconic and enchanting. Nevertheless, we tend to take the rose for granted – it is, after all, ubiquitous; you can buy a bunch in any supermarket. Text the word “rose” and an emoji pops up. Society has been over-rosed. But as Gertrude Stein said, “Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose,” thus we can’t let the iconic idea of the rose obscure the rose itself; it is extraordinary. Have you smelled one recently?

There is fossil evidence that roses grew in the wild 35 million years ago. Humans began cultivating the flower thousands of years ago in China, the Mediterranean and the Middle East. According to flower historians, Europe began to grow its own roses commercially in the late 18th century. Roses were so beloved and coveted the flower has served as currency, and was a key ingredient in all kinds of medicine. (According to the Herbal Encyclopedia, in the 1st century CE, Pliny the Elder recorded thirty-two different medicinal uses of the rose.)

In the U.S. in particular, roses are in such demand – a dozen, the Valentine’s Day gift de rigeur – that growers were breeding them for appearance, longevity and affordability. Because of chemicals and refrigeration, their scent was practically undetectable.

Thankfully, the rose aroma has been revived. British rose breeder David Austin is largely credited for restoring fragrance to the rose. Thanks to Austin, and now his son, we can choose from many dozens of fabulously fragrant varieties, that are also aesthetically breathtaking and repeat flowerers.

 With more than 150 species and thousands of hybrids available,  you can choose a rose in nearly any color and shape, and now, fragrance. If you have trouble choosing, the American Rose Society has been around since 1892 and is a good source of information. You may even find a rose society in your own town. Or just go to a florist and ask for their most fragrant variety. 

Enjoy the above suggestions. Fragrant flowers not only inspire memories but can also evoke profoundly positive feelings, often simultaneously. Our olfactory receptors stimulate the part of our brains believed to create emotions. Simply, sweet-smelling flowers make us happy!
